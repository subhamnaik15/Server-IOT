# Megathon-Server-IOT

The REST API is written in nodeJS and Express, which is hosted in AWS EC2 instance. 
We have used mongoDB Atlas as noSQL database.
To continuously run the Server, we are using process manager, PM2 which runs in the background even when the instance is inactive
We have pused puTTy to connect to SSH AMI Linux instance, which is a t2.micron instance.
